Cyberspace Security Lab, School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University

## Research Fields

My main works focus on the security of the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET). These works include but are not limited to cyber-attacks, vulnerability mining, and application of some cryptography-related techniques in VANET. Currently, my researches revolve around the following areas.

- Sensor attacks against autonomous driving systems
- Internet attacks and defenses (especially in web-related areas)
- Endogenous security, Mimic defense, DHR(Dynamic, heterogeneous and Redundancy) architecture.
